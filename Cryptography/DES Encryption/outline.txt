Inputs:
- a block of 64 bits, unencrypted
- a master key of 56 bits (actually 64 bits but 8 bits get removed)
    - this master key is used to create round keys of 48 bits each

Outputs:
- a block of 64 bits, encrpyted

Steps of the DES encryption algorithm:
- (generating the key)
- initial permutation
- 16 rounds of encryption
- final permutation

Things I need to create:
- master key generator (must be cryptographically safe; this can be added later, use dummy keys for now)
- round key generator
- initial permutation
- final permutation (undoes the initial permutation)
- Feistel network
